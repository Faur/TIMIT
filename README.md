# TIMIT
Framewise phoneme classification on the TIMIT dataset using neural networks

The recurrent neural network is strongly inspired by the work by Alex Graves: Supervised Sequence Labelling with Recurrent Neural Networks (2012) http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~graves/preprint.pdf

The code was originally created for the course '01666 Project work - Bachelor of Mathematics and Technology' at The Techincal University of Denmark by Toke Faurby and Kristoffer Linder-steinlein.
